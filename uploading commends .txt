Deployment

0 =-=-=-=- git init

1 =-=-=-  npm run build

creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js file.


Building for Relative Paths
By default, Create React App produces a build assuming your app is hosted at the server root.

To override this, specify the homepage in your package.json, for example:

GitHub Pages
Note: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.0 and higher.

Step 1: Add homepage to package.json
The step below is important!

If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.

Open your package.json and add a homepage field for your project:

2 =-=-=-=-=-    "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",  

now edit this url to this

  "homepage": "https://ShameemAnsari3.github.io/2todoreactapp",



Step 2: Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json

3 -=-=-=--=  npm install --save gh-pages



Add the following scripts in your package.json:

4 =-=-=-=-  "predeploy": "npm run build",
	    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",



Step 3: Deploy the site by running npm run deploy
5 -=-=-=- npm run deploy

The project was built assuming it is hosted at /2todoreactapp/.   
You can control this with the homepage field in your package.json.

The build folder is ready to be deployed.
